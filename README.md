Android AutoImageFlipper Library Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'AutoImageFlipper Library Demo' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('AutoImageFlipper Library Demo App') on the top. Then in the body an image is stretched to full screen size. 
At the bottom of the image are a series of radio buttons that show the position of the image (which image is currently displayed).
The images automatically change to another image in the collection. If the user clicks an image a Toast message appears giving the position
of the clicked image. Example: 'Position 8'.

Screen cap images and video of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/javaApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
